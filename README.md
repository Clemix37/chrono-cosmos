Selection of the character is still in development.
You enter the game by selecting a player and its statistics.

## Tests

### Formulas

`toDecimal` should round a decimal to the number of decimals given in arguments, by default 2  
Ex:

-   `toDecimal(2.4156844)` => `2.42`
-   `toDecimal(2.4136844)` => `2.41`
-   `toDecimal(2.4156844, 3)` => `2.416`
-   `toDecimal(2.4136844, 3)` => `2.414`
-   `toDecimal(2.4156844, 4)` => `2.4157`
-   `toDecimal(2.4136844, 4)` => `2.4137`

`formatEnergy` should format the energy based on the number itself
Ex:

-   `formatEnergy(0)` => `0`
-   `formatEnergy(1)` => `1`
-   `formatEnergy(100)` => `100`
-   `formatEnergy(999)` => `999`
-   `formatEnergy(1e3)` => `1K`
-   `formatEnergy(1e4)` => `10K`
-   `formatEnergy(999999)` => `999.999K`
-   `formatEnergy(1e7)` => `10M`
-   `formatEnergy(1e10)` => `10B`

### Data

`getRandomFromArray` should return random defined element from array  
`generateRandomId` should return a random id based on current date for uniqueness

### Config

`getDefaultConfig` should return the default config without player's name, level to 0 and the status "not started"

### Character

`Character` should be a class containing id, name, age, speed, intelligence, strength properties and should return a template with `getDisplayTemplate`  
`generateRandomStat` should return random stats between max and minimum of each statistic  
`generateThreeRandomCharacters` should create three different characters, return an array containing the three and each one having different values  
`getCharacterGeneratedById` should get the character created with this id and return it
